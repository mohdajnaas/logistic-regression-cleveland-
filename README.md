# Project Title: Heart Disease Classification with Logistic Regression and Feature Importance Analysis

# Project Description:

The Heart Disease Classification project utilizes logistic regression to build a predictive model for heart disease classification based on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. This project aims to not only assess the initial accuracy and feature importance of the logistic regression model but also systematically evaluate the impact of dropping the least important attributes on both accuracy and feature importance.

# Key Features:

1. Dataset Selection: The project utilizes the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, a widely used dataset for cardiovascular disease prediction. The dataset includes various attributes related to patients' health.

2. Logistic Regression Model: Employ logistic regression, a powerful classification algorithm, to train a model for heart disease prediction. Logistic regression provides interpretability and allows for the analysis of feature importance.

3. Feature Importance Analysis: Print the initial feature importance of the logistic regression model. This analysis helps identify which attributes have the most significant impact on the model's predictions.

3. Accuracy Measurement: Evaluate the initial accuracy of the logistic regression model in classifying heart disease cases. Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. Iterative Feature Elimination: Systematically drop the least important attributes one by one and assess how the accuracy and feature importance change with each iteration. This step helps understand the impact of individual attributes on the model's predictive capabilities.

# Dependencies:

The project relies on popular Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning implementation (including logistic regression), and Matplotlib for data visualization.
